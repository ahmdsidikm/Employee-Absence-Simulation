A simulation of an AI-based Automatic Attendance System using Facial Recognition, built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript using the Face-API.js library. This system is designed as a single-page web application (SPA) that enables employee face registration and real-time attendance. Employee data (including facial feature descriptors) and attendance records are stored directly in the browser’s Local Storage.

The system’s main functionality is divided into three tabs: Face Registration, Automatic Attendance, and Employee Data. In the Face Registration tab, users can activate the webcam to detect faces, fill in details such as Employee ID and Name, and then register their face, where the system will store a unique facial descriptor along with a profile photo. Meanwhile, the Automatic Attendance tab allows the system to detect faces live in front of the camera, match them with stored descriptors, and automatically record Check-In or Check-Out attendance by displaying a pop-up notification that includes the detection accuracy (confidence).
